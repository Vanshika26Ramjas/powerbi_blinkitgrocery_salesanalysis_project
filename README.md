# powerbi_blinkitgrocery_salesanalysis_project
Analyzed the Blinkit grocery dataset to evaluate outlet performance, customer buying patterns, and product demand to support data-driven decision-making.  Built and designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track sales trends, outlet performance, and customer preferences across multiple dimensions (location, size, item type, and fat content).
